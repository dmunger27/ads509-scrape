"The Power Of Love"



The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight
are rolling by like thunder now as I look in your eyes
I hold on to your body and feel each move you make
your voice is warm and tender a love that I could not forsake
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man
whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms
when the world outside's too much to take
that all ends when I'm with you
even though there may be times it seems I'm far away
but never wonder where I am cause I am always by your side
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man
whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something somewhere I've never been
sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
'bout the power of love

The sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly
the feeling that I can't go on is light years away
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man
whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can
We're heading for something somewhere I've never been
sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
